# Pokémon Emerald: bear Edition

Just my project aimed at improving Pokemon Emerald. This is based on - and wouldn't be made possible without - the [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) disassembly by PRET.

The battle engine balance is completely changed from Gen. 3 - expect a feel more like Gen. 4 or 5.

The current plan is to have Pokemon up to Gen. 4 be obtainable.
